The files used for the prediction tool are index.html, toolScript.js, and toolStyle.css in the folder Main NN code.
The files index.html and provisions.js in the folder Rückstellungen CODE and indexKG.html and kgScript.js in the folder Main NN code were used to create and train the two used NNs.

The other files were included in the process of creating the most accurate prediction tool, but they did not influence the final product.
